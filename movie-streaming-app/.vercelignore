# Vercel Deployment Configuration
# This file is automatically created by Vercel

# No special configuration needed - Next.js is auto-detected
# Vercel will automatically:
# - Install dependencies
# - Run `npm run build`
# - Deploy to edge network
# - Enable automatic HTTPS
# - Provide preview deployments for branches

# For custom configuration, you can add a vercel.json file
